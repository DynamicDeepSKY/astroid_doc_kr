Geolocation and Time
----------------------

Time is automatically updated according to your device's time but you have to put long and lat information manually. Initially these are set to 0 and you will see the red GPS icon on the top status icon location. Time and GPS information is important to properly draw the predicted sky.

After setting your GPS location, it is good idea to double check it with other software such as stellarium-web.org. Check if the four cardinal directions and the location of Milky Way is identical on both side. 

Marker
------------------

The red circle on the image is where your main telescope is looking at. Adjust your mount to put any object within this circle. You will see the same object in your main telescope.


Align with Main Lens
--------------------

The first thing you need to do is aligning Astroid to main telescope lens. Not like conventional finder scope you don't need to physically move your finder. Instead Astroid support a digital way to align it.

1. Go to Astro Tools under setting menu and check FinderAlign
2. Move your main telescope and put some bright and unique object such as the Moon
3. Adjust the joystick pad on the bottom left corner and to move the target mark to the center of the object.
4. Uncheck the FinderAlign option and close the setting menu
5. Check if the alignment is correct by moving the scope and aiming the other object. If the new object is visible on both side your alignment is good to go.

Note that the location of the mark is automaitically save to your Astroid so that you don't need to do it again next time.


Time Adjust
------------------

Basically the planetarium will show you the current sky. But you can draw the past and future sky by adjusting the time bar. Supported range is -10 to +10 hours to the current time.


Star Finder
------------------

Astroid has built-in NGC, IC, M, HIP star list. To use star finder, find the number of the star object you are interested and put it to the search bar. It will show you it's photo and other information as well.



Guide Lines
------------------

Once you clicked any star on the star finder list, Astroid will display the location of the target and how many degree you should rotate along the left/right and up/down direction. Adjust your mount addording to this angle. Currently, EQ mount guide line is not supported but this feature will be added in the future.
