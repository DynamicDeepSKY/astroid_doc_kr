Making A Remote System
======================

You can turn your telescope into a powerful remote observatory.

1. Connect Astroid to the home WIFI
2. Forward the port number 80 to Astroid in you router setting page. The router's setting page is usually 192.168.0.1. Talk to your internet service provider if you need help regarding the router setting.
3. Type your static IP address in the internet browser to see your Astroid page. Now, anyone on earth who knows your IP can access to your Astroid.
